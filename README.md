# Win32-GUI-Test
A Test/Example of graphic user interface application Win32 style for Microsoft Windows using the MinGW64 resources.
I've tested it on Windows 10 x64, Windows 7 x64, Windows XP x64 and Windows XP x86. I don't know if it will work on Windows 11.

I made this code just for fun. Don't expect professional performance from it.
